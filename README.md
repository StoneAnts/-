# Cat-fishing

There is a game named Cat fishing of Poker card, we need two players--A,B, and dividing the cards into two parts and take one for each player. A takes out the first poker card and puts it on the table, and then, B takes out one and puts it on the A's. And They turn out in turn. If the card is the same as the card on the table, you can take all the two same cards and the cards in the middle, and put them at the end of their hands in turn. When all the cards in the hands of any one are out, the game is over and the opponent wins.
